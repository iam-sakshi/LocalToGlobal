You will need an OTP verification prior to registration and a confirmation slip/token will be generated after registration. You will also get a confirmatory sms later.

For all Private Hospitals, prior registration and appointment will be the only method of registration.

For Government hospitals, a proportion of slots will be available for online registration and appointment, the rest will be kept for on site registration and vaccination.

Appointments for any date for a Vaccination Center will be closed at 12:00 pm on the day prior to the date.</details></li>

<li><details ><summary>Out of the multiple vaccines available, how is one or more vaccine chosen for administration?</summary>
The safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of vaccine candidates are examined by Drug Regulator of our country before granting the license for the same. Hence, all the COVID-19 vaccines that receive license will have comparable safety and efficacy. However, it must be ensured that the entire schedule of vaccination is
 completed by only one type of vaccine as different COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable.</details></li>
 <li><details ><summary>Indian regulators have given authorization to Covaxin even before its Phase 3 trial results were out. How do we explain this?</summary>
We are passing through COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has caused social disruption, economic downturn and significant number of deaths. To control this pandemic, the society as well as the system may have to take steps which may also be termed as drastic. Both pre-clinical and clinical data (complete data for Phase I and II, and partial data for Phase III) of Covaxin have been thoroughly scrutinized by the regulators. This data shows that the vaccine is safe and induces a robust antibody response. However, to what extent the vaccine will protect the recipients from getting the disease is not fully known yet. 
Therefore, the regulators have allowed its use in trial mode.</details></li>
<li><details ><summary>Will COVID-19 vaccine be given to everyone simultaneously?</summary>
Based on the potential availability of vaccines the Government of India has selected the priority groups who will be vaccinated on priority as they are at higher risk. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive COVID-19 vaccine was the persons over 60 years of age and persons between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbid conditions. From April 1st, 2021, People above the age of 45 years (born before 1st Jan, 1977) are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine. From May 1, 2021, 
all eligible citizens above the age of 18 years can get the COVID-19 vaccine.</details></li>
<li><details><summary>Is it important for me to receive the same vaccine during second dose?</summary>
As the vaccines available are not interchangeable, it is important to receive the second dose of same vaccine as the first one. The Co-WIN portal is also going 
to help to ensure that everyone receives the same vaccine</details></li>
<li><details close><summary>Does this vaccine provide herd immunity?</summary>
When an increasing number of people get vaccinated in the community, indirect protection through herd immunity develops. The percentage of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity varies with each disease. For example, its 95% for measles, however the proportion of the population 
that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known.</details></li>
